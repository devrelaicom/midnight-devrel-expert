description: This skill is the reference catalog of GitHub Actions security anti-patterns (pull_request_target misuse, script injection via ${{ }}, overbroad GITHUB_TOKEN permissions, unpinned actions, cache/artifact poisoning, credential persistence) to apply while writing or editing a workflow when no tool is being run. For an automated security scan that returns file:line findings, use gha-security-audit (which runs zizmor) instead — this skill is the knowledge those findings map onto. Other gha skills and agents that draft or reason about workflow content should reference this skill rather than re-deriving this knowledge.

# GitHub Actions Security Anti-Patterns

Check workflow content against the anti-patterns below whenever creating,
editing, or reviewing a `.github/workflows/*.yml` file. This is reference
knowledge, not an executable check — the `gha-security-audit` skill runs
`zizmor` for automated detection; this skill exists so the same knowledge
is available even when `zizmor` isn't run, e.g. while `gha-creator` is
drafting a new workflow.

The companion `gha-runtime-pitfalls` skill covers failure modes that pass
every static check and only surface on a live runner. Some of them carry a
security dimension this catalog also cares about — a fork PR's read-only
token (which pushes people toward `pull_request_target`, governed by the
untrusted-checkout pattern below) and `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`/`$GITHUB_ENV` heredoc
handling (a `${{ }}`-adjacent injection surface). Read that skill too when
writing or auditing a workflow.

## `pull_request_target` with untrusted checkout

`pull_request_target` runs with the base repo's permissions and secrets,
even for PRs from forks. If a step then checks out the PR's head ref
(`actions/checkout@vX` with `ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}`
or similar) and later runs code from that checkout, a malicious fork PR can
execute arbitrary code with access to the base repo's secrets.

Flag: `on: pull_request_target` combined with any checkout of
`github.event.pull_request.head.*` followed by running that checked-out
code (build scripts, `npm install` with lifecycle scripts, etc).

Prefer `pull_request` (safe by default, runs with fork permissions) unless
there's a specific need for base-repo secrets — and if there is, avoid
checking out or executing untrusted head content at all.

## Script injection via `${{ }}` in `run:` steps

Interpolating untrusted context values directly into a `run:` shell script
lets an attacker inject shell commands. Untrusted values include
`github.event.issue.title`, `github.event.pull_request.title`,
`github.event.comment.body`, `github.head_ref`, and similar user-controlled
fields.

Flag: any `run:` step with `${{ github.event.* }}` or `${{ github.head_ref }}`
interpolated directly into the script body.

Fix: pass the value through an environment variable instead, so the shell
never sees it as literal script text:

```yaml
- run: echo "$TITLE"
  env:
    TITLE: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
```

## Overbroad `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions vary by repo setting, and a workflow
that doesn't declare `permissions:` explicitly can end up with far more
access than it needs (e.g. write access to contents, issues, and PRs for a
job that only needs to read).

Flag: a workflow or job with no `permissions:` block, or a `permissions:`
block broader than the job actually uses.

Fix: set `permissions: {}` at the workflow level and grant only what each
job needs at the job level, e.g. `permissions: { contents: read }`.

## Unpinned third-party actions

An action referenced by a mutable tag (`uses: some/action@v1` or `@main`)
can change behavior — maliciously or accidentally — without the workflow
file changing. Only a full-length commit SHA is immutable.

Flag: any `uses:` referencing a non-SHA ref for a third-party (non-`actions/*`,
non same-org) action.

Fix: pin to the full commit SHA with the human-readable version as a
trailing comment (`uses: some/action@<40-char-sha> # v1.2.3`) — this is
what the `pinact` tool (via `gha-maintain`) automates.

## Credential persistence via `actions/checkout`

By default `actions/checkout` writes the job's `GITHUB_TOKEN` into the local
`.git/config` (`persist-credentials: true`) so later steps can push. That token
then lives on disk for the rest of the job — any step that uploads the
workspace as an artifact, or any later untrusted code, can read it back out
(the "ArtiPACKED" class; `zizmor` flags it as `artipacked`).

Flag: an `actions/checkout` step without `persist-credentials: false` in a job
that does not itself use the stored credential to push back to the repo.

Fix: set `persist-credentials: false` on the checkout unless a later step
genuinely needs the persisted credential — and when it does, keep that job's
scope tight and avoid uploading the workspace as an artifact.

## Cache and artifact poisoning

Build caches and uploaded artifacts are sometimes restored or consumed by
later, more-privileged jobs or workflows (e.g. a `pull_request` job uploads
an artifact that a privileged `workflow_run` job later downloads and
executes). If the producing job runs untrusted code, the artifact/cache can
carry a payload into the privileged context.

Flag: a workflow that downloads an artifact or restores a cache produced by
a job triggered from a less-trusted context (fork PRs) and then executes
its contents (runs a script from it, `source`s it, installs it) in a more
privileged context.

Fix: treat artifacts/caches crossing a trust boundary as untrusted input —
validate or re-verify before executing anything from them, or avoid the
cross-boundary handoff entirely.
